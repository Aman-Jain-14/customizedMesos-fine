### USAGE ###
>        /logging/toggle

### TL;DR; ###
Sets the logging verbosity level for a specified duration.

### DESCRIPTION ###
The libprocess library uses [glog][glog] for logging. The library
only uses verbose logging which means nothing will be output unless
the verbosity level is set (by default it's 0, libprocess uses levels 1, 2, and 3).

**NOTE:** If your application uses glog this will also affect
your verbose logging.

Query parameters:

>        level=VALUE          Verbosity level (e.g., 1, 2, 3)
>        duration=VALUE       Duration to keep verbosity level
>                             toggled (e.g., 10secs, 15mins, etc.)


### AUTHENTICATION ###
This endpoint requires authentication iff HTTP authentication is
enabled.
